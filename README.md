This project utilizes a bank telemarketing dataset to predict whether or not the individual signed up for a savings account.  R was used throughout, with ggplot to present the data analysis, and ROSE to correct for an unbalanced dataset.  The end result was a RandomForest classifier that achieved a XX% overall accuracy.
